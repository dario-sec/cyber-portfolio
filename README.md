## 🚀 Roadmap & Goals

The focus of this portfolio is to document my progression from foundational skills to practical, real-world cybersecurity expertise. Current medium-term goals include:

- Consolidating a strong understanding of network, web, and operating system security through hands-on labs and CTF platforms.  
- Building a collection of write-ups that demonstrate structured methodologies for reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation.  
- Developing custom offensive and defensive tooling in Python to automate repetitive tasks and support red/blue team workflows.  
- Deepening skills in reverse engineering and malware analysis using tools such as Ghidra and related frameworks.  
- Preparing for an industry-recognized certification in penetration testing or offensive security.
